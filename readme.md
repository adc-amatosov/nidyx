# nidyx

nidyx generates Objective-C models from JSON schema. It also supports
generating with [JSONModel](https://github.com/icanzilb/JSONModel) support.


## usage

```
usage: nidyx [-h | --help] [--version]
       nidyx <schema> [target] [-j | --json-model]

    -j, --json-model                 Generate with JSONModel support
        --version                    Show version

nidyx generates plain Objective-C models from JSON Schema. That's pretty much
it. Oh yeah, it also supports generating with JSONModel support! Pretty rad.
```
